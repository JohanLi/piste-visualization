# Piste Visualization

The vision of this project is to create:

* An interface where users can create and edit pistes, through marking
their boundaries using Google Maps.
* A backend storing all such pistes, including altitude information.
* A visualization of all pistes. In particular, being able to compare pistes and inspect their steepness.

## Background

When learning how to ski, being the risk-averse adult that I am, I would always do some research on resorts and pistes
I hadn’t tried before. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t skiing down slopes that were too steep.

Two things became apparent: some resorts inflate their difficulty ratings, and the altitude information of Google Maps
is rather inaccurate.

For this project, I’m going to obtain altitude data from Lantmäteriet (The Swedish National Land Survey) which has a
resolution of 2 meters.
